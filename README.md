# VoidForge AI – Gesture Controlled 3D Builder

## 1. Project Description
VoidForge AI is a browser-based interactive application that allows users to create and control 3D objects using hand gestures captured through a webcam.  
The system replaces traditional mouse and keyboard input with real-time gesture recognition, creating a natural human–computer interaction experience.

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision can be used in 3D virtual environments.

## 2. Key Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection
- Webcam-based interaction (no controller required)
- Creation and manipulation of 3D objects
- Visual feedback during interaction
- Audio feedback for user actions
- Runs directly in a web browser

---

## 3. Technologies Used
- Programming: JavaScript
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3
- 3D Rendering: Three.js / WebGL
- Computer Vision: Hand Tracking (MediaPipe or similar)
- Audio: Web Audio API

---

## 4. System Requirements
- Laptop/PC with webcam
- Modern web browser (Google Chrome recommended)
- Windows or Linux operating system
- Proper lighting environment

---

## 5. Installation
1. Download or clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/VoidForge-ai.git

2. Open the project folder.

3. Run the application:
   - Open "index.html" in your browser
   OR
   - Use Live Server in VS Code (recommended)

## 6. How the System Works
1. The webcam captures real-time video.
2. The hand-tracking model detects hand landmarks.
3. Gestures are identified from finger positions.
4. The system converts gestures into actions.
5. The 3D engine updates objects based on user movement.

## 7. Basic Controls
- Show Hand → Activate detection
- Move Hand → Move cursor
- Pinch Gesture → Create or select object
- Change Gesture → Modify object

---

## 8. Project Modules
- Camera Module – Captures webcam input
- Gesture Recognition Module – Detects hand gestures
- 3D Rendering Module – Displays and updates objects
- Interaction Module – Maps gestures to actions
- Audio Module – Provides sound feedback
